Kobold Kit includes external open source code from other developers.
Most external code included in Kobold Kit will use MIT or closely related and
compatible licenses.


Allowed Licenses for External Code:
===================================

For developers who consider adding an external library you can do so if the
library is released under one of the (unmodified) licenses below:

* Apache 2.0 License
* Apple Public Source License
* BSD Licenses labelled "New" or "Revised" or "Modified" or "Simplified"
* Boost Software License
* CC-BY or CC-BY-SA (any version), ie code snippets from stackoverflow.com
* Fair License
* FreeBSD License
* GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
* MIT License
* zlib License
* Other FSF approved Licenses: please contact us at license@koboldkit.com


Disallowd Licenses for External Code:
=====================================

You must refrain from including source code obtained from Software released
under one of the following licenses:

* BSD "Original" License: 4-clause license which includes the text:
	"[..] must display the following acknowledgement [..]"
* Code Project Open License (any code obtained from: www.codeproject.com)
* GNU General Public License (GPL), any version

Do double check the GNU licenses - there's the "lesser" LGPL which is allowed
and then there's the GPL which is not allowed.


Generally Disallowd External Code:
==================================

You must refrain from including source code that is not expressly released
under a (proper) open source software license.

* Any "fair use". Ie any code copied from forum or blog posts without express
	permission or license attached. There is no "fair use" for code, nor is fair
	use applicable internationally. 
	See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3016629/what-constitutes-as-fair-use-for-code
* Any "gift", "donation" or "I don't care" license (ie Beerware license).
* Any kind of "used with permission". Ask for permission to apply MIT License.
* Any allowed open source license that was modified by the software author.
* No license file included and no license text in source code headers.
	By definition this is proprietary code!

Please contact the library's author if no license is attached, or conflicting
licenses are used, or the license is based on an allowed open source license
but has been modified in any way.

What you can do is copy & paste "trivial" code and code that performs a common
task. Essentially code that anyone uses in almost exactly the same way.

If in doubt, contact us: license@koboldkit.com


How to attribute:
=================
Whenever possible, attribute the user's full name. If it's a company, attribute
the company in addition unless the copyright is solely to the company already. 

If there's only a user synonym, attribute the user's synonym and where said
synonym was used. For example: "Copyright (c) by user SNAFU on greatcode.org".

Including a link to the original Software is optional. Links can not be used
as substitute for properly attributing the author because links can break.
